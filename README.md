##In this task, I developed a responsive webpage that fetches and displays real-time weather data from a public API. The goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing weather application that dynamically loads and displays weather information based on user input. The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework for styling and responsiveness. Additionally, I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representing the current weather conditions.

The webpage features a clean and intuitive design, with a central weather card that includes an input field for users to enter a city name. Upon clicking the "Get Weather" button or pressing the "Enter" key, the application makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap using the provided city name. The API returns real-time weather data in JSON format, which is then dynamically displayed on the webpage. The displayed information includes the city name, current date and time, weather icon, temperature in Celsius, weather description, wind speed, and humidity percentage. The weather icon is dynamically updated based on the current weather conditions, providing a visual representation of the weather.

To enhance the user experience, I implemented error handling to manage cases where the city name is invalid or the API call fails. If the city is not found or the API request fails, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to try again. This ensures that the application remains user-friendly and provides clear feedback in case of errors. The webpage also includes a date and time display, formatted using Moment.js, to provide users with the current date and time alongside the weather information.

The design of the webpage is modern and visually appealing, with a gradient background and a centered weather card that uses Bootstrap for responsiveness. The weather card includes subtle animations to enhance the user experience, making the application feel dynamic and interactive. The use of Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons further enhances the visual appeal of the webpage, providing a polished and professional look.

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party APIs into a web application, dynamically update the DOM based on API responses, and create a responsive and user-friendly interface. It also highlights my skills in using JavaScript for asynchronous data fetching and DOM manipulation, as well as my proficiency in using CSS and Bootstrap for styling and layout. The project is a great example of how to build a functional and visually appealing web application that leverages external data sources to provide real-time information to users.
